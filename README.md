# DadaIt

DadaIt is a program that creates interesting text using the [fold-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique) technique. In case you haven't already clicked on that link, this is a technique that William S. Burroughs used to write weird books. The text that it creates can be weird and interesting. There is no other reason for this, other than for fun (and as a fun project for me to play with ReasonML).

## How does it work?

Give `dadait` two URLs for online texts and a number of words per line, and dadait will pull the text and work its magic.
